 <h4>DRAWING TOOL SETS</h4>
 
 TopoDroid comes with six sets of drawing tools:
 <ul>
 <li>speleology</li>
 <li>archeology</li>
 <li>geology</li>
 <li>biology</li>
 <li>paleonthology</li>
 <li>mining</li>
 </ul>
 
 By default only the speleology tools are installed.
 <br>
 With the "PALETTE" menu of the main window you get a dialog to install additional tools.
 Check the tool sets you want to install and press the button "Install".
 <br>
 If you press the button "Replace" the currently installed tools are removed before
 installing those you selected.
 <br>
 <p>
 
 After installing you must enable the tools you need, using the "Palette" button
 of the main window.
