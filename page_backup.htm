<h4>Sketch Reload</h4>

This dialog is opened by the <u>Reload</u> menu of the <i>Sketch</i> window.<br><p>

TopoDroid maintains backup copies of sketch files, from which the sketch can be recovered.<br>
TopoDroid keeps a set of four backup copies for each sketch file.
These are named with suffixes "bck", "bck0", "bck1", and "bck2" and are stored in the <i>th2</i> (Therion files)
or <i>tdr</i> (binary files) subdirectory. Whenever a sketch is saved the backup copies are rotated
(eg, "bck1" is renamed "bck2", and so on; "bck" is renamed "bck0"),
the old "th2" or "tdr" file is renamed with suffix "bck", and the sketch is saved to a new "th2" or "tdr" file.
<br><p>

TopoDroid saves a sketch whenever it is modified (eg, a new item is added, or part of the sketch is erased)
while it is open. Only one backup is used in this case: the old saved copy being renamed with suffix "bck".
<br><p>

The sketch is saved only if you have made changes to it, otherwise it is not saved and the backup copies are not rotated.
<br><p>

The dialog shows the list of the sketch backups with
<ul>
<li>size of the file (in bytes)</li>
<li>how long ago it was written, with suffixes for minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), months (M) and years (Y)</li>
<li>filename</li>
</ul>
<br><p> 

To recover a sketch you choose which copy to load.<br>
The filename is shown above the list.<br>
Next you tap the <b>OK</b> button to confirm.<br>
The <u>Back</u> key closes the dialog without reloading the sketch.
