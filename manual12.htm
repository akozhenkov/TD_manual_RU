<h3>[12] OVERVIEW WINDOW</h3>

You get into the Overview window from the "OVERVIEW" menu of the Drawing window.
<br>
The Overview window displays all the sketches together, either in plan or in profile view depending on the view of the Drawing window.
The overview window can be either in normal mode (canvas shift and zoom), or in measure-mode.<br><p>
The Overview window has two buttons:
<ul>
<li><i>measure-mode</i> switches the window in "measure mode"</li>
<li><i>references</i> display the reference dialog, through which the user can swith on/off the display of midline, splay shots, station names, and metric grid.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

<h4>Measure-mode</h4>
When the Overview window is in measure-mode you can measure the distance between two points on the canvas.
To do this you tap first on the first point: this is displayed as a pink circled cross. Next you tap on the
second point: this is shown with a blue cross and the 2D distance is shown in the title bar, together with the differences along the X and Y axes, and the bearing (plan) or inclination (profile).
The distance units is the the sketch grid units (either meter or yard). The angle is in the current angle units (degrees or grad).<br>
Any further tap changes the second point (and the measures).<br>
To reset the first point tap on the "measure-mode" button.<br>
The distance is computed in the plane of the canvas. In plan view, this is the horizontal distance. In profile view the Y-axis difference is the difference in elevation.<br><p>
