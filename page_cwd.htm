<h4>Текущий Рабочий Каталог </h4>

TopoDroid не управления сложными проектами с большим количеством съёмок. However it is possible to specify a different current work directory (CWD) for the data files. Each CWD is a subdirectory of the primary external memory, and it is created if it does not exists. The name of the current work directories must begin with "TopoDroid". If you specify a name that does not begin like this, it is prependend the string "TopoDroid".<br><p>

The drawing symbol files and the files related to the DistoX (devices database, firmware, memory dumps, calibrations) are installed only in the default directory "TopoDroid". The other current work directories contain only the survey database and survey files.<br><p>

You can use different directories for different cave survey projects.  Alternatively you can have one "TopoDroid" directory for each project and switch to the one you must work on when you need by renaming directories with a file manager. However in this way the common utility files are replicated.<br><p>

The choice of the current work directory is one of the general settings of the app (main window).<br><p>
