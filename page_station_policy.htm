<h4>Station naming policies</h4>

When you download data TopoDroid can automatically assign them station names. A repeated measurement is considered a leg shot, the others are splay shots.  If you stick to a convention taking measurements TopoDroid automatic station naming can be very handy. TopoDroid supports a number of conventions to automatically assign stations to shots. You can select the one that fits your habits through the settings.
<ul>
<li>at the "From" station: you take splays first and then forward leg shot(s). This is the default convention.</li>
<li>at the "From" station: you take the forward leg shot(s) first, and then the splays</li>
<li>at the "To" station: you take splays first and then backward leg shot(s)</li>
<li>at the "To" station: you take backward leg shot(s) first and then splays</li>
<li>at a station: you take the backshot to the previous station, next the splay shots, and finally the forward shot to the next station.</li>
</ul><br><p>

A survey with compensation of the local magnetic anomaly must use the last policy.<br>
Examples of the five conventions (shots takes at the same station are grouped in parenthesis):
<ul>
<li> ... (1-. 1-. 1-. 1-2) (2-. 2-. 2-3) ... </li>
<li> ... (1-2 1-. 1-. 1-.) (2-3 2-. 2-.) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-. 2-. 2-. 2-1) (3-. 3-. 3-2) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-1 2-. 2-. 2-.) (3-2 3-. 3-.) ... </li>
<li> ... (2-1 2-. 2-. 2-3) (3-2 3-. 3-. 3-4) ... </li>
</ul><br>
