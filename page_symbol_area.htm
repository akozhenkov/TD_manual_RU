<h4>AREA TOOLS</h4>

The "area" tools are defined in text files.<br><p>

Two area tools, "user" and "water", are built in the programs.
The others are loaded from the TopoDroid subdirectory <i>symbol/area</i>.
This directory is populated with the area tools packaed in the distribution apk.
You can delete the tools you do not need, edit the ones you want to change, and
add new ones that are not provided in the apk.<br><p>

The area tool file contains lines specifying the property of the drawing tool.
<ul>
<li>"symbol area" [mandatory]</li>
<li>"name NAME", where NAME is the area default name [mandatory]</li>
<li>translated names, eg, "name-es ..." [optional]</li>
<li>"th_name NAME", where NAME is the Therion name, and must be the same as the filename [mandatory]</li>
<li>"color rgb alpha" (rgb and alpha in hex format) [mandatory]</li>
<li>"close-horizontal" [optional, false if missing]</li>
<li>"orientable" [optional, false if missing]</li>
<li>"bitmap WIDTH HEIGHT X_TILE Y_TILE" starts of the bitmap pattern. The tile modes can be M (mirror) or R (repeat). This line must be followd by HEIGHT lines of length WIDTH with the bitmap pixels (1: foreground, 0: background).</li>
<li>"endbitmap" marks the end of a bitmap</li>
<li>"csurvey LAYER CATEGORY PEN BRUSH"</li>
<li>"endsymbol"</li>
</ul>

<b>Close-horizontal</b><br>
If this attribute is set the area border is closed horizontally in the profile view
and in the cross-sections.<br>
The Y coordinate of the last point of the draw lines is replaced with that of the first point.
By this means you can draw areas with a flat horizontal top profile.<br><p>

Currently, this attribute it is only for the built-in "water" tool.<br><p>

<b>Bitmap pattern</b><br>
With this option you can specify a background pattern, eg, for differentiating rock
formations.<br><p>

This attribute is not used in any tool packaged in the apk.<br><p>

<b>Orientation</b><br>
If the attribute "orientable" is set, the area pattern can be rotated through the area edit dialog.<br><p>
