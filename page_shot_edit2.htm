<h4>Shot edit (2)</h4>

This dialog is opened long-tapping the shot entry in the <i>Shot list</i> window.<br><p>

It shows the shot stations and data (length, azimuth, inclination).<br><p>

At an activity level "Basic" or "Normal" this dialog has only a button to <b>Delete</b> the shot.<br><p>

At higher activity levels it has five buttons:
<ul>
<li><a href="page_photo_comment.htm">Photo</a> dialog</li>
<li><a href="page_sensors.htm">Sensor measurement</a> dialog</li>
<li><b>Add</b> a shot before this (manually entering the data)</li>
<li><b>Split</b> the survey at this shot (creating a new survey)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the shot</li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The <b>delete</b> button does not remove the shot from the database.
The shot gets marked as "deleted" and can be later recovered with the "Recovery" dialog.<br><p>

<b>Survey split</b><br>
This button opens a dialog for the new survey info.
Next the survey data are assigned to the new survey, beginnig with this shot.
Afterwards the program continues with the new survey. You may need to split surveys when you have data from two (separate) survey pieces stored in the DistoX: these are downloaded to a single survey which must be then split accordingly.<br><p>
