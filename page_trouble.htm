<h4>DistoX troubleshooting</h4>

<b>DistoX scan</b>
TopoDroid may fail to find a DistoX on the first scan, and you might have to try two or three times before the DistoX is found.<br><p>

If the DistoX scan fails repeatedly, you may try a scan with the <i>Settings</i> app. If this app too fails to find the DistoX, there is some problem with the bluetooth on your Android, and you will not be able to use TopoDroid with a DistoX.<br><p>

<b>DistoX pairing</b>
Before TopoDorid can connect to the DistoX, this must be paired with the Android. If the "auto-pair" option is selected, a pairing dialog should appear when you select a found DistoX after a scan. The DistoX PIN is 0000 (four zeros).<br><p>

Alternatively you can pair Android with the current DistoX throught the "pair" manu or you can use the <i>Settings</i> app to pair the DistoX.<br><p>

Once paired with the DistoX, the Android should keep the pairing, and not request the PIN again. If it keeps requesting the PIN every time you download data from the DistoX, try to use the "insecure" socket.<br><p>

If you have problem connecting and downloading the data try to enable the "Z6 workaround".<br>
