<h4>Survey import</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Import</u> button in the main window.<br><p>

It displays the list of files that can be imported in the app.<br><p>

TopoDroid can import the survey files in the followng formats:
<ul>
<li><i>Therion</i>: ".th" data files, with simple data format ("normal from to length compass clino" and optionally LRUD).
Therion scrap are not imported.</li>
<li><i>Compass</i> ".dat" files (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>VisualTopo</i> ".tro" files (not fully tested)</li>
<li><i>PocketTopo</i> ".top" files. Data and drawings are imported (not fully tested)</li>
<li>TopoDroid ZIP archives. These are special zip files with the informations to repopulate the database, the drawings (".th2" files), the annotation file, and the photos.</li>
</ul><br>

Zip archives are searched in the "zip" directory (that is where TopoDroid saves them). Survey files are searched in the "import" directory. Therefore you must copy the survey file you want to import in this directory. If the survey name of the file to import already exists in the database the file is not imported.<br><p>
