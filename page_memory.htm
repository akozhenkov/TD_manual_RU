<h4>DistoX memory</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Memory</u> button of the <i>Device</i> window.<br><p>

<ul>
<li><b>Dump</b> reads the content of the DistoX memory. 
You must enter the initial and final memory location in the two text fields to its right.</li>
<li>Optional <b>filename</b> to save the dump</li>
</ul>
<br>

Only for DistoX A3:
<ul>
<li><b>Read</b> the memory cursors</li>
<li><b>Store</b> the memory cursors</li>
<li><b>Reset</b> a portion of memory, ie, marks it "to-be-downloaded"</li>
</ul>

The content of the DistoX memory is displayed in the "Memory list" dialog.<br><p>

Reading the DistoX memory directly is a slow process, and the DistoX must be kept "ON" while doing it.
It is advisable to read a portion of memory, say 50 entries, at a time.
Be patient: this operation is carried out in the main gui thread.<br><p>

If you have entered a filename it is also saved to a dump file (in the "dump" folder).<br><p>

Memory inspection requires some knowledge of the internals of the DistoX: at a minimum the address space, and the way data are stored. You should have read the DistoX documentation before using it.<br><p>
