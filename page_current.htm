<h4>Current station</h4>

The current station is the station from which the survey will continue.
If you have set the current station, TopoDroid will continue numbering stations from it. If the current station is not set, the last one is used.<br><p>

Thus you can start a branch in the middle of the survey by selecting the station you want to attach as current station. To set the current station long tap on the station name in the shot list (a normal tap toggles the display of the relevant splay shots when the display of splays is globally disabled). The current station is highlighted green in the shot data window. A long tap on another station switches the current station. A long tap on the current station turns it off. Alternatively, you can replace the from station of the first shot of the branch, afterwards.<br><p>

The current station can be set in three ways
<ul>
<li>with a long tap on the station name in the shot data window.</li>
<li>through the <i>Station edit</i> dialog in the <i>Sketch</i> window.</li>
<li>selecting the station from the <i>Saved stations</i> dialog</li>
</ul>
