<h4>New survey</h4>

Thsi dialog is opened tapping the <u>Add</u> button in the <i>Main</i> window.<br><p>

Information for the new survey:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b></li>
<li><b>date</b></li>
<li><b>team</b></li>
<li><b>initial station</b></li>
<li>magnetic <b>declination</b></li>
<li>survey <b>description</b></li>
</ul>
<br><p>

The <b>name</b> is mandatory. It must be unique in the database. The survey names are used to list surveys in the main window and TopoDroid distinguishes surveys by their name (although each survey has a unique numerical id in the database).<br>
<b>The name of the survey cannot contain the character '/' (slash), which is the pathname separator.</b><br><p>

The <b>date</b> is written with format "yyyy.mm.dd". For example January 6, 2015 is "2015.01.06". It is preset to the current date.<br><p>

<b>Team</b> and <b>description</b> are empty (unless you have set a default team in the app settings). They can safely be left so, although it is a good practice to take the time to fill them.<br><p>

The <b>magnetic declination</b> is 0.0 by default. If you know it you can enter it here, otherwise you can look it up in the web after you have found the coordinates of a fixed point (say, the cave entrance) with the GPS [A].<br><p>

<b>Save</b>: the new survey name is added to the database.<br>
<b>Open</b>: saves and starts the <i>Shot list</i> activity immediately.<br><p>
