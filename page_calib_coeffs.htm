<h4>Calibration coefficients</h4>

This dialog displays the 24 coefficients of the calibration linear transformations for the <b>G</b> and the <b>M</b> vectors (12 coefficients each) and 3 coefficients of the non-linear terms (only DistoX2 v. 2.3 or higher).<br><p>

It is used in three different situations:
<ul>
<li>The <u>Read</u> button of the <i>Device</i> window display the coefficients read from the DistoX.</li>
<li>The <u>Read</u> button of the <i>Calibration</i> window displays the coefficients stored in the database</li>
<li>The <u>Compute</u> button of the <i>Calibration data</i> window displays the computed coefficients</li>
</ul>

In the last case the dialog displays also an histogram of the residual errors of the calibration data,
the average error, the std deviation, the maximum error, and the number of iterations taken by the calibration computation.<br><p>

The error of a calibration data is the angle between the data and the average vector of the group the data belongs to, after having taken the calibration correction into account. The errors are reported in degrees.<br><p>

The histogram has ticks on the horizontal axis at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 degrees.<br>
On the vertical axis the tick marks are 10 and 20.<br><p>
The yellow vertical line marks 0.5 degrees, and the red line 1 degree.<br>

This dialog has a button to <b>write</b> the coefficients to the DistoX.<br><p>
