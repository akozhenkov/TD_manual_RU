<h4>Databases</h4>

It is useful to have a rough idea about the organization of the information and the data in the databases. The units of work in TopoDroid are the surveys and the calibrations. A survey is a single survey session of a piece of cave.  A calibration is a single DistoX calibration.<br>
Surveys are stored in the "distox14.sqlite" database. There is one such database in every work directory.<br>
Calibrations are stored in the "device10.sqlite" database, together with the DistoX informations. This database is global and is present only in the "TopoDroid" directory.<br>
<p>
 
Accordingly, the most important table in the survey database is:
<ul>
<li><b>surveys</b>: survey informations</li>
</ul><br>
The surveys records store the survey name, date, team, magnetic declination, initial station name and possibly a comment.<br>

Related to the surveys are the tables for:
<ul>
<li><b>shots</b>: survey data</li>
<li><b>stations</b>: saved stations</li>
<li><b>plots</b>: 2D sketches; plans, profiles, cross sections</li>
<li><b>photos</b>; pictures associated to survey shots</li>
<li><b>sensors</b>: measurements associated to survey shots</li>
<li><b>fixeds</b>: (geolocalized stations)</li>
<li><b>sketches</b>: 3D models</li>
</ul><br><p>

The most important tables in the device database are
<ul>
<li><b>devices</b>: devices informations</li>
<li><b>calibs</b>: calibrations informations</li>
</ul><br>
 
The calibs records contain the calibration name, date, DistoX device, algorithm, and the results of the last computation: coefficients, average error, maximum error, number of iterations.<br><p>

Related to the calibrations is the data table
<ul>
<li><b>gms</b>: calibration data</li>
</ul><br><p>

Finally each database has the table
<ul>
<li><b>configs</b>: configuration values</li>
</ul><br><p>

You can learn more about the data organization in the database by looking at it with a SQLite viewer.<br><p>
