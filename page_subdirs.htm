<h4>TopoDroid subdirectories</h4>

Here is some background about how the survey data, the calibration data, and the sketches are stored. You can safely skip the following and the next two sections, and come back to them later if needed.<br><p>

The app creates its default base directory, named "TopoDroid", in the primary external memory (usually /sdcard). This directory is not removed when you uninstall the app. In this directory the app creates two SQLite databases. The first is "device10.sqlite", where the calibration data, the DistoX informations, and other data are stored. The second is "distox14sqlite" and stores the surveys data. The app also creates subdirectories for the different types of files:
<ul>
<li>bin: DistoX2 firmware files</li>
<li>csv: CSV text files (exported surveys and calibrations)</li>
<li>csx: <i>cSurvey</i> files (exported surveys and sketches)</li>
<li>dat: <i>Compass</i> files (exported surveys)</li>
<li>dxf: DXF files (exported surveys and sketches)</li>
<li>dump: DistoX memory dump files</li>
<li>import: survey files to import (<i>Therion</i>, <i>Compass</i>, <i>VisualTopo</i>, and <i>PocketTopo</i> format)</li>
<li>kml: <i>GoogleEarth</i> exports [A]</li>
<li>note: survey annotations text files</li>
<li>photo: survey pictures (each survey with its own subdirectory)</li>
<li>plt: <i>OziExplorer</i> track file exports [A]</li>
<li>png: PNG image files (exported sketches)</li>
<li>srv: <i>Walls</i> files (exported surveys)</li>
<li>svg: SVG files (exported sketches)</li>
<li>svx: <i>Survex</i> files (exported surveys)</li>
<li>symbol with the drawing tools files (points, lines, areas)</li>
<li>th: <i>Therion</i> files (exported surveys)</li>
<li>th2 for <i>Therion</i> scrap files (saved sketches)</li>
<li>th3 for 3D model files</li>
<li>tmp: for temporary files. Any file leftover in this directory can be safely deleted.</li>
<li>top: <i>PocketTopo</i> files (exported surveys)</li>
<li>tro: <i>VisualTopo</i> files (exported surveys)</li>
<li>zip: survey ZIP archives (exported and importable)</li>
</ul><br><p>

Some of these subdirectories are used only to store exported files (csx, dat, dxf, png, svx, th, top, tro). Others are used to store data (th2, th3, note, photo). The subdirectory "symbol" contains data files used by the program.
The subdirectory "zip" is used to store zipped archives as well to read them and uncompress in TopoDroid. When you want to import a survey made with another program (<i>Therion</i>, <i>Compass</i>, <i>VisualTopo</i>, or <i>PocketTopo</i>) you must place it in the subdirectory "import". Finally "bin" is used to store firmware files, both the factory files included in TopoDroid and the firmware dumps read from a DistoX.<br><p>
