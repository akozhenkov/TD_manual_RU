This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Station</u> button in the <i>Shot list</i> window.<br><p>

The "saved stations" are stations saved for later reference, eg, at a crossway, to go back and continue the
survey from there, or to mark a possible lead to check in a future trip.<br><p>

The dialog displays the list of saved stations. You select one by tapping it.<br><p>

The selected station is shown in the text fields. Initially there is the 
last station, or the current station if set.
Each saved station must have a brief description (comment) or a flag set.<br><p>

<ul>

<li><b>Save</b> the station into the database</li>
