<h4>Calibration data distribution</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Distribution</u> button in the <i>Calibration data</i> window.<br><p>

It displays the distribution of the calibration data, in azimuth and inclination, ie, on a 3D sphere.<br><p>

The sphere is opened up as an ellipsis: the north in the middle, east to the right, west to the left and south on the outer border. Positive inclination in the upper hemisphere, negative in the lower one. It can show either the angular distribution of the raw data, or that of the data corrected with the calibration.<br><p>

<b>Eval</b> computes the angular distribution using the raw direction values.<br>
<b>Eval. w clib.</b> computes the distribution after correcting the data with the calibration coefficients.<br><p>
