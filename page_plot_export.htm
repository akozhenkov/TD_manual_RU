<b>Sketch exports</b><br>

Sketches are stored either in TopoDroid binary format or in Therion format (as th2 files).<br><p>

The Therion format is textual and is human readable with a text editor.
It is a good choice for small sketches.<br><p>

The Topodroid binary format is more compact and speeds up the sketch opening and saving.
This is particularly noticeable for large sketches and/or low-end devices.
If you selecgt to save sketches in binary format and you use Therion for the final map, 
you should covert them to th2 files (with the "th2 convert" menu of the "Survey info" window)
before exporting the ZIP archive.<br><p>

Exporting a sketch as <i>Therion</i> will save a new copy.<br><p>

The <b>cSurvey</b> export file contains both the plan and the profile sketches. However it does not has the cross-sections. Cross-sections cannot be exported as cSurvey files, and you need to export as images if you want to use them for postprocessing with cSurvey.<br><p.

The resolution of <b>PNG</b> images is an adjustable setting. However a larger and more detailed image requires more CPU time and may fail due to memory limits. If it fails TopoDroid tries reducing the resolution until it succeeds exporting the sketch as PNG image file.<br><p>

Sketches can be exported as 2D <b>DXF</b> files. The AutoCAD version of the exported DXF files can be either 6 or 12. In the former cubic lines are replaced by polylines. For the latter splines are used, however there are issues loading DXF saved with version 12 in AutoCAD.<br><p>
