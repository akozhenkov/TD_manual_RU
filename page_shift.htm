<h4>Sketch shift and flip</h4>

<b>Sketch shift</b><br>
The drawing can be shifted as a whole by selecting the "Fix ref" checkbox in the sketch reference dialog. Then in "move/zoom" mode the drawing can be shifted by dragging it with two fingers.<br><p>


<b>Profile sketch flip</b><br>
When viewing the profile, a long tap on the "Plan/Profile" button opens a confirmation dialog to flip the profile sketch horizontally. The dialog has a checkbox to reverse the extend direction of the shots as well. This is enabled by default. Only the shots up to the "barrier" stations, are reversed. In particular shots hidden by "hiding" stations are reversed. Therefore if you want to reverse only a portion of the shots you should first set "barrier" stations.<br><p>
