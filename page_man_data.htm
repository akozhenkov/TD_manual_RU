<h4>Manual data input</h4>

If you do not have a DistoX you can still enter the shot data manually. 
Tapping the <u>Add</u> button opens the dialog for the shot data input. 
You must enter the station names and the shot data (length, azimuth, and clino).
Additionally you can type the LRUD, and select whether these refer to the FROM station or to the TO station.
The "compass" button sets the direction (azimuth and clino) using the Android sensors.
It has a timer (10 s by default) to allow you to point the device before measuring.
The "reverse" button allow to swap the stations, ie, reverse the shot.<br><p>

To add a splay shot enter "." (period) or "-" (dash) in the "To" station.
LRUD can be added to a splay shot, thus providing additional splay shots.
In this case the LRUD refer to the "From" station.<br><p>

The <u>Save</u> button at the bottom inserts the shot into the survey, and updates the station names incrementing them so that the dialog is ready to input the next shot. The <u>OK</u> button inserts the shot in the survey, and closes
the dialog. If LRUD are specified the respective splay shots are also inserted.<br><p>
